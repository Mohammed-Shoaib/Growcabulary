## Contribute to the Website

### Website Suggestions

* Slightly darker shade for the navbar.
* Add better router navigation: Make every _view_ unique by adding support in the URL. This allows sharing the link and seeing what was shared, common items sharing the same link isn't good.

### Future Ideas

* User profile with statistics such as the WPM and learning progress.
* Show the image for _each_ definition.
* Add support for multiple images by using slideshow.
* Enlarge the image on hover.
* Allow to hide attributes: These may include the image, notes, synonyms, etc.
* Click on a word _anywhere_ on the website and get taken to the meaning if it exists.
* 2 folders for images, one containing small 250 x 250 images and one containing large 750 x 750 images. The large ones are for enlarged images which get shown on hover. The preprocessing helps to load the images faster as some images are super large and take time to load otherwise.
* Typing test which contains just the _words_ alone to test for spelling and reiterate the definition in your head.
* Show the user the number of _corrections_ that were made and the number of _errors_ that were made.
* Keyboard shortcut buttons to do things such as play audio (US/UK), next word, previous word, etc.
* For self-evaluation of spelling or the spell-check component: press enter upon completion of word to make sure the user can't correct it if the _actual_ word is longer, this allows for false positives.
* If the user types the spelling incorrectly, give him an option to practice by typing the word 5 times.
* Show the words the user has typed incorrectly, maybe with a click of a button.
* Summarize the results at the end of completing a set.
	- Show the average WPM
	- Show the total time taken
	- Show the incorrect words
	- Show the average accuracy
* Allow the user to **flag** certain words for review later.
* Allow the user to add a word just by typing it. Perhaps you can fetch all the information like the definition, synonyms, antonyms, example, etc. from _sources_.
* Deal with words which are duplicate of each other in terms of parts of speech. For example, Pollyanna and Pollyannaish.
